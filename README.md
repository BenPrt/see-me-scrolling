# See Me Scrolling : A vertical slideshow animation

As part of a job technical interview, the goal of this test was to estimate my technical skills on a slideshow-like scrolling animation reproduction.
I had to do this in less than 2 hours (git history as proof).

I choosed to use VueJS because it's lightweight and easy/quick to set-up. I also choosed this one because it's the modern Javascript framework (even if VueJs is a library) that I know less from the three most popular starters (Angular, ReactJs and VueJs, not Charmander, Bulbasaur or Squirtle).

The project also includes TypeScript, Sass and TSLint.

## Project setup

```
npm install
```

I would also recommend to execute this command to have the less vulnerable libraries possible :

```bash
npm audit fix
```
### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
npm run build
```

### Lints the project

```
npm run lint
```
