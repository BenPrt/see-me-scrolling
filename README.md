# Atecna Technical Test : A vertical slideshow animation

The goal of this test was to estimate my technical skills on a slideshow-like scrolling animation reproduction.

The original animation could be found [here](https://atecna.gitlab.io/front/exercices-tests/animation-scroll/).

I choosed to use VueJS because it's lightweight and easy/quick to set-up. I also choosed this one because it's the modern Javascript framework (even if VueJs is a library) that I know less from the three most popular starters (Angular, ReactJs and VueJs, not Charmander, Bulbasaur or Squirtle).

The project also includes TypeScript, Sass and TSLint.
